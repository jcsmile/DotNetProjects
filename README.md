- ProductApi is a webapi built on .NET 9 for a demo purpose. The API provides regular product functions seen in an eCommerce application. This API uses AWS cognito OAuth for authentication and authorization. In order to test it, make a http post to /api/auth/token to get an access token. Then put this token as authorization bearer token when revoking any endpoint of this api. To illustrate the data storage, this API connects to Entityframework in-memory db which is filled with predefined product data when the application starts. The API docment can be viewed through [/swagger/index.html]. API endpoints can be tested through swagger UI as well.
